# MODEL_On_HA
This repository contains my winter internship work on deep learning model development, optimization, and edge deployment. It includes image classification and object detection models using CNN, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and EfficientDet-D0, optimized with TensorFlow Lite and INT8 quantization for Raspberry Pi and FPGA deployment.
